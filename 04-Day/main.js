// Exercises: Level 1
// 1.Get user input using prompt(“Enter your age:”). If user is 18 or older , give feedback:'You are old enough to drive' but if not 18 give another feedback stating to wait for the number of years he neds to turn 18.
// let age = prompt('Enter your age')
// switch(true){
//   case age >= 18:
//     console.log('You are old enough to drive')
//     break;
//   case age == 15:
//     console.log('You need 3 more years to be able to drive')
//     break; 
// }

// 2.Compare the values of myAge and yourAge using if … else. Based on the comparison and log the result to console stating who is older (me or you). Use prompt(“Enter your age:”) to get the age as input.

// let num =prompt("Enter your age")
// let myAge;
// let yourAge;
// if (myAge > yourAge) {
//   console.log(`I am ${myAge} years older than you`)
// }else {
//   console.log(`you are &{yourAge} older than me`)
// }

// 3.If a is greater than b return 'a is greater than b' else 'a is less than b'. Try to implement it in to ways

let a = 3
let b = 4
if (a > b) {
  console.log('a is greater than b')
}else {
  console.log('a is less than b')
}
